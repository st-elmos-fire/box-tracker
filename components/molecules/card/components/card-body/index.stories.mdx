# Card body

The Card body component is the body section of any component which supports a card like layout (Look for the <WorksWith component="cards" /> badge in the story). It should not be used standalone.

The CardBody component adds padding to the content placed within it and is also set to `overflow-y: auto` to
allow for scrolling if the content is too long. This can be disabled by adding a className prop to the CardBody
component and disabling it manually in CSS.

See the [Card](?path=/docs/atom-card--default-story) component docs for more information.
