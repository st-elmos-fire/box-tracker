# Card

The Card component is a container for content that is typically displayed in a card. It is primarily just a wrapper for the content
displaying the appropriate styles.

By default, the card only has a background, a border-radius and a drop shadow (all of which can be disabled) and displays the content in a
in a single row css grid layout. It relies on the child components to set the appropriate width, height and internal spacing.

External spacing around the card should ideally be set by the parent component but you can add spacing to the card itself by passing in
the `vSpacing` and/or `hSpacing` boolean props.

You can also pass a `className` prop and style it yourself but this is discouraged unless absolutely necessary.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="Default">
    <Card>
      <p>This card is the default card with all of the styling intact</p>
    </Card>
  </Story>
  <Story name="NoShadow">
    <Card noShadow>
      <p>This card has had the shadow styling disabled.</p>
    </Card>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Usage

You can pass any child you want to the Card component, but to get the best out of it, you should use the pre-styled CardHeader and CardBody components.

### CardBody

The CardBody component adds some extra padding and automatically expands to the available space within the card.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="WithCardBody">
    <Card>
      <Card.Body>
        <p>
          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec eget ex
          euismod, consectetur nunc eget, maximus nunc.
        </p>
      </Card.Body>
    </Card>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### CardHeader

The CardHeader component adds some extra padding and a bottom border to the card.

The component automatically detects there are 2 children here and has adjusted the CSS
grid layout to make room for the header.

<Tip type="danger">
  This component is not that smart, it assumes if there are two children then
  the first one is a CardHeader.
</Tip>

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="WithHeader">
    <Card>
      <Card.Header>
        <div>Header goes here</div>
      </Card.Header>
      <Card.Body>
        <p>
          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec eget ex
          euismod, consectetur nunc eget, maximus nunc.
        </p>
      </Card.Body>
    </Card>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Supports Cards

<a id="compatibility"></a>

The CardHeader and CardBody component were made for the `Card` component, however they also work as children of other components. If you see a <WorksWith component="cards" /> badge on a component, it means that
the CardBody and CardHeader components have been tested and work well.

## Props

<ArgsTable of={Card} />
