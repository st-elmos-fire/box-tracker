# Table Body

The `TableHead` component is literally just a wrapper around the `thead` component
and is only included for the purposes of styling.

Please refer to the [Table](?path=/docs/molecule-table--default-story) or [TableGenerator](?path=/docs/organism-tablegenerator--default-story) components for usage examples.
